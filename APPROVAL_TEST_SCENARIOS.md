# Job Seeker Approval System - Test Scenarios

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive test scenarios to validate the fixes implemented for the job seeker approval/rejection functionality. These tests ensure that the system works correctly and consistently across different scenarios.

## Test Environment Setup
- **Frontend**: React application with updated approval components
- **Backend**: Express.js API with profile management endpoints
- **Database**: Prisma ORM with Profile model
- **Authentication**: Admin user with proper permissions

## Phase 1: API Service Layer Tests

### Test 1.1: Profile ID Extraction
**Objective**: Verify that profile IDs are correctly extracted from different data structures

**Test Steps**:
1. Create test profiles with different data structures:
   - `{ id: 123, profile: { id: 456 } }`
   - `{ profileId: 789 }`
   - `{ profile: { id: 101 } }`
2. Call `extractProfileId()` on each structure
3. Verify correct ID is returned

**Expected Result**: 
- First case: Returns 123 (prioritizes top-level id)
- Second case: Returns 789
- Third case: Returns 101

**Success Criteria**: All profile IDs are correctly extracted without errors

### Test 1.2: Profile ID Validation
**Objective**: Ensure invalid profile IDs are properly rejected

**Test Steps**:
1. Test with invalid IDs: `null`, `undefined`, `"abc"`, `-1`, `0`
2. Call `validateProfileId()` on each
3. Verify validation results

**Expected Result**: All invalid IDs return `false`, valid numeric IDs return `true`

### Test 1.3: API Service Calls
**Objective**: Verify API service functions work correctly with new utilities

**Test Steps**:
1. Call `approveJobSeeker()` with valid profile ID
2. Call `rejectJobSeeker()` with valid profile ID and reason
3. Call `getProfilesByStatus()` with different statuses
4. Monitor console logs for operation tracking

**Expected Result**: 
- All API calls succeed
- Proper logging is generated
- Response data is consistent

## Phase 2: State Management Tests

### Test 2.1: Race Condition Prevention
**Objective**: Ensure multiple simultaneous operations don't interfere with each other

**Test Steps**:
1. Rapidly click approve/reject buttons on different profiles
2. Monitor loading states
3. Verify only one operation per profile can run simultaneously
4. Check that operations complete in correct order

**Expected Result**: 
- Loading states prevent multiple operations
- No race conditions occur
- All operations complete successfully

### Test 2.2: Optimistic Updates
**Objective**: Verify UI updates immediately while API calls are in progress

**Test Steps**:
1. Click approve button on a profile
2. Verify profile moves from pending to approved list immediately
3. Wait for API response
4. Verify final state is correct

**Expected Result**: 
- UI updates immediately (optimistic)
- Final state matches API response
- Rollback occurs if API fails

### Test 2.3: Sequential Data Refresh
**Objective**: Ensure data refreshes happen sequentially to prevent conflicts

**Test Steps**:
1. Perform approval operation
2. Monitor console logs for refresh sequence
3. Verify data is refreshed in correct order

**Expected Result**: 
- Refresh operations happen sequentially
- No concurrent fetch conflicts
- Data consistency maintained

## Phase 3: UI Component Tests

### Test 3.1: ApprovalActions Component
**Objective**: Verify action buttons render correctly based on profile status

**Test Steps**:
1. Test with profiles in different states: pending, approved, rejected
2. Verify correct action buttons are shown
3. Test button disabled states during operations
4. Verify loading indicators work correctly

**Expected Result**: 
- Correct actions available for each status
- Buttons disabled during operations
- Loading states visible

### Test 3.2: ApprovalQueue Component
**Objective**: Ensure queue displays and manages profiles correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Load page with pending profiles
2. Test approve/reject operations
3. Verify profile counts update correctly
4. Test pagination functionality
5. Verify error handling and success messages

**Expected Result**: 
- Profiles display correctly
- Operations work as expected
- Counts update in real-time
- Pagination functions properly

### Test 3.3: RejectionReasonModal Component
**Objective**: Verify rejection modal works correctly

**Test Steps**:
1. Open rejection modal for a profile
2. Test validation (empty, too short, too long reasons)
3. Submit valid rejection reason
4. Verify modal closes and operation completes

**Expected Result**: 
- Validation works correctly
- Modal submits successfully
- Profile is rejected with reason

## Phase 4: Error Handling Tests

### Test 4.1: Network Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify system handles network failures gracefully

**Test Steps**:
1. Disconnect network or simulate network failure
2. Attempt approval/rejection operations
3. Verify error messages are displayed
4. Test retry functionality
5. Verify error recovery

**Expected Result**: 
- Clear error messages displayed
- Retry options available
- System recovers when network restored

### Test 4.2: Validation Error Handling
**Objective**: Ensure validation errors are properly displayed

**Test Steps**:
1. Submit invalid data (empty rejection reason, invalid profile ID)
2. Verify validation error messages
3. Test error dismissal
4. Verify form state is maintained

**Expected Result**: 
- Validation errors clearly displayed
- User can dismiss errors
- Form state preserved

### Test 4.3: Server Error Handling
**Objective**: Verify server errors are handled appropriately

**Test Steps**:
1. Simulate server errors (500, 400 responses)
2. Verify error messages are user-friendly
3. Test error recovery options
4. Verify logging captures error details

**Expected Result**: 
- User-friendly error messages
- Recovery options available
- Detailed logging for debugging

## Phase 5: Performance & Reliability Tests
