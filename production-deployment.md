# üöÄ Production Deployment Plan - Internationalized ViewProfile

## **Phase 5: Production Deployment**

### **Deployment Objectives**
- Deploy to staging environment for testing
- Validate production build integrity
- Ensure language switching works in production
- Monitor for any runtime issues

---

## **üåç Deployment Environment**

### **Staging Environment**
- **URL**: `https://staging.job-portal.com`
- **Purpose**: Pre-production validation
- **Testing**: Language switching, performance, user acceptance

### **Production Environment**
- **URL**: `https://job-portal.com`
- **Purpose**: Live user access
- **Monitoring**: Performance, errors, user feedback

## **üîß Deployment Process**

### **Step 1: Pre-Deployment Validation**
- [ ] Build production bundle successfully
- [ ] Run all tests in staging
- [ ] Validate language switching functionality
- [ ] Check bundle size and performance
- [ ] Verify all translation keys are present

### **Step 2: Staging Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to staging environment
- [ ] Run smoke tests
- [ ] Test language switching in staging
- [ ] Validate ViewProfile component
- [ ] Check for console errors

### **Step 3: Production Deployment**
- [ ] Deploy to production environment
- [ ] Monitor deployment health
- [ ] Run post-deployment tests
- [ ] Validate language switching
- [ ] Monitor error rates

## **üß™ Deployment Testing Checklist**

### **Functionality Tests**
- [ ] ViewProfile page loads correctly
- [ ] Language switching works (EN ‚Üî RW)
- [ ] All 45+ text elements translate properly
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Component renders smoothly

### **Performance Tests**
- [ ] Initial load time < 2s
- [ ] Language switch time < 500ms
- [ ] Memory usage stable
- [ ] No performance degradation

### **Integration Tests**
- [ ] Navigation between pages works
- [ ] Language preference persists
- [ ] No conflicts with other components
- [ ] API integrations work correctly

## **üìä Production Monitoring**

### **Key Metrics to Monitor**
1. **Error Rates**: < 0.1% of requests
2. **Performance**: 95th percentile < 2s
3. **Language Usage**: Track EN vs RW preference
4. **User Feedback**: Monitor for translation issues

### **Monitoring Tools**
- **Error Tracking**: Sentry or similar
- **Performance**: Web Vitals, Lighthouse
- **Analytics**: Google Analytics, custom metrics
- **User Feedback**: Support tickets, user surveys

---

## **üö® Rollback Plan**

### **Rollback Triggers**
- Critical errors affecting > 5% of users
- Performance degradation > 50%
- Language switching completely broken
- Security vulnerabilities detected

### **Rollback Process**
1. **Immediate**: Revert to previous version
2. **Investigation**: Identify root cause
3. **Fix**: Resolve the issue
4. **Re-deploy**: Deploy fixed version
5. **Validation**: Confirm fix works
